# Legal-Team-AutoGen
This is a multi-agent system created in AutoGen. This system serves as a legal team that gives legal advice to the user according to their case. 
Each agent is given a specific task and at the end, the legal_summary_agent will combine their findings/responses into a single response for the user.
